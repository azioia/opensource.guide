We try not to get involved in these disputes. However, we reserve the right, at any time and in our sole discretion, and without notice to you, to determine rightful Account or site ownership and to transfer an Account or site to such owner.

For example, if you're on an annual subscription plan, each billable renewal period will be for one (1) year. We\u2019ll automatically charge you the applicable amount using the payment method you have on file with us. We\u2019ll let you know in advance if you\u2019re purchasing a Paid Service that includes auto-renewal payments. You can disable auto-renewal at any time via the Services or emailing customer support at support@streamlabs.com<\/p>\n<h5>Refunds<\/h5>\n<p>While you may cancel any Paid Services at any time, you won't be issued a refund except in our sole discretion, or if legally required.<\/p>\n<h5>Fee Changes<\/h5>\n<p>We may change our fees at any time.

MISUSE OF THE DMCA CAN SUBJECT YOU TO LIABILITY.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Disputes - ARBITRATION<\/h4>\n<p>Before bringing a formal legal case, please first try contacting our Customer Support team. Most disputes can be resolved that way.\n<p>To the extent permitted under applicable law, any and all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the breach thereof, or any use of the Websites (including all commercial transactions conducted through the Website) (\"Claims\"), except for claims filed in a small claims court that proceed on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis, shall be settled by binding arbitration before a single arbitrator appointed by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") in accordance with its then governing rules and procedures, including the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, where applicable. In agreeing to arbitrate all Claims, you and %{appName} waive all rights to a trial by jury in any action or proceeding involving any Claim. The arbitration shall be held in San Francisco, California, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof. This arbitration undertaking is made pursuant to and in connection with a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act at 9 U.S.C. Section 1, et seq. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement. Subject to the limitations set forth below, the arbitrator shall have authority to award legal and equitable relief available in the courts of the State of California, provided that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n    <li>The arbitrator shall not have authority to award punitive damages; and<\/li>\n    <li>Any and all claims shall be arbitrated on an individual basis only, and shall not be consolidated or joined with or in any arbitration or other proceeding involving a Claim of any other party. You and %{appName} agree that the arbitrator shall have no authority to arbitrate any Claim as a class action or in any other form other than on an individual basis.<\/li>\n    <li>For any Claims that are not subject to arbitration: (a) the exclusive jurisdiction and venue for proceedings involving Claims shall be the courts of competent jurisdiction sitting within San Francisco County, California (the \"Forum\"), and the parties hereby waive any argument that any such court does not have personal jurisdiction or that the Forum is not appropriate or convenient; (b) you and %{appName} waive any and all rights to trial by jury with respect to any Claims.<\/li>\n    <li>In the event that either party initiates a proceeding involving any Claim other than an arbitration in accordance with this Section, or initiates a proceeding involving a Claim under this Section other than in the Forum, the other party shall recover all attorneys' fees and expenses reasonably incurred in enforcing this Agreement to arbitrate and the Forum to which the parties have herein agreed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>NO CLASS ACTIONS. We all agree that we can only bring a claim against each other on an individual basis. That means: (a) neither you nor %{appName} can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action or representative action; (b) an arbitrator cannot combine more than one person\u2019s claim into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class or representative arbitration proceeding (unless we both agree to change this); (c) an arbitrator\u2019s decision or award in one person\u2019s case can only impact the person who brought the claim, not other %{appName} users, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other users. If a court decides that this subsection on \"No Class Actions\" is not enforceable or valid, then the entire section covering Disputes will be null and void, but, the rest of the terms of these Terms of Use will still apply.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Miscellaneous<\/h4>\n<p>These Terms of Use shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. Any claim or dispute between you and %{appName} that arises in whole or in part from the Terms of Use, the Websites or any Contest shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in San Francisco County, California.<\/p>\n<p>Nothing in the Terms of Use shall create or confer any rights or other benefits in favor of any third parties except as specifically provided herein. By participating in any Contest on the Websites, you agree to indemnify, protect, defend and hold harmless %{appName}, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates and divisions, and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives, from and against any and all third party claims, liabilities, losses, damages, injuries, demands, actions, causes of action, suits, proceedings, judgments and expenses, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, court costs and other legal expenses including, without limitation, those costs incurred at the trial and appellate levels and in any bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency or other similar proceedings, and any other legal expenses (collectively, \"Claims\") arising from or connected with your use of the Websites, any payment methods used, any funding of your account, and\/or your participation in any Contest.

If you continue to use the Services after we change the Terms of Use, you accept all changes. The failure of %{appName} to comply with any provision of these Terms of Use due to an act of God, hurricane, war, fire, riot, earthquake, terrorism, act of public enemies, actions of governmental authorities outside of the control of the Company (excepting compliance with applicable codes and regulations) or other force majeure event will not be considered a breach of these Terms of Use.<\/p>\n<p>Notice for California Users: Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, California Websites users are entitled to the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted in writing at 400 R Street, Suite 1080, Sacramento, California, 95814, or by telephone at (916) 445-1254 or (800) 952-5210<\/p>\n<p>%{appName} AND OTHER TRADEMARKS CONTAINED ON THE WEBSITES ARE TRADEMARKS OR REGISTERED TRADEMARKS OF %{appName} IN THE UNITED STATES AND\/OR OTHER COUNTRIES.
